<p>With <i>Advance – Stay put / idle<i>, the router.gallery exhibits two works by digital media artist Lauren McCarthy in the frame of <a href="https://www.ctm-festival.de/">transmediale & CTM Vorspiel</a>. 
Both of Lauren McCarthy’s works; Later Date (2020) and Social Turkers (2013), are navigating notions of/the desire for social interaction, intimacy and agency and the potential role of digital communication technologies as their facilitator. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Social Turkers (2013):</b>
In her performance Social Turkers Lauren live streams a number of dates employing Amazon Mechanical Turk - a “crowdsourcing marketplace,“ used to outsource tasks to a distributed workforce who can perform the assignments virtually. The artist lets the MTurks make decisions on her behalf and guide her through the encounters.
<br>
<br>
<b>Later Date (2020):</b>
Later Date is a highly topical work on the desire for - the indefinitely postponed possibility of - physical social interaction in times of the pandemic.
Later Date is a work in two parts: the router.gallery is showing the documentation of plans made between the artist and various participants, while the second part will take place at an agreed upon later date, when both parties will receive email requests to meet and enact the script. Visitors of the router.gallery will be asked to plan their own future Later Dates.
<br>
<br>
In line with CTM festival theme Transformation the artist’s works are hybrids of on- and offline performances and their documentation on the internet equally. As the router.gallery takes the web pages offline, it highlights them not only as archive/documents created by the artist to make the original performance accessible, but as works of art operating as narrative/storytelling instruments themselves. 
<br>
While with Social Turkers the potential for intimacy and physicality is overtly apparent, it is at the same time meditated, enabled and interrupted by the MTurks. 
Later Date on the other hand is an emphatic deceleration of the omnipresent demand for communication by type of Zoom calls. Conversations in Later Date are reduced to a text only chat between two participants pursuing the need for intimacy – a format perfectly fit for the intimate experience enabled by the router.gallery.
