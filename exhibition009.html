<p>Come experience artificial wildlife in its natural environment! Tropical Bot Safaris invites the public to take a trip on some of the hottest Brazilian WhatsApp groups. Connect your smartphone to our digital agency at router.gallery and leave immediately for the bot-infested jungles of instant messaging. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to get a taste of the conspiracy theories and fake news that are corroding the country’s democracy – first-hand, in real-time and in a foreign language! Other top attractions include: endearing copypasta, dodgy business proposals, sticker battles, emoji mosaics and local ASCII crafts. (Almost) carbon free!

Tropical Bot Safaris is part of an ongoing exploration of mobile Internet vernaculars. It delves into the audiovisual unconscious of contemporary culture, making a spectacle out of the sometimes shady, sometimes candid, and often machine-driven content circulating across instant messaging apps.

Any spam you get is a souvenir to bring home.

<h3>WhatsApp Cinema</h3>
<code>at panke.gallery, 31 Oct, at 19pm</code>
<p>For the opening of Tropical Bot Safaris, panke.gallery will host an impromptu session of WhatsApp Cinema. Part projection performance, part group therapy, WhatsApp Cinema is a strategy for exploring our neglected mobile media archives. The audience takes turns connecting their phones to a screen and, collectively, trying to make sense of whatever audiovisual residuum they find in there. Participation is open, free, and frequently unpredictable.
