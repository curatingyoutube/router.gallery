<a id="context" class="anchor" href="#conext" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Context</h3>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.ctm-festival.de/">transmediale & CTM Vorspiel</a>, the router.gallery is presenting <span style="font-style:italic">Advance – Stay put / idle</span>, an exhibition featuring two works by digital media artist Lauren McCarthy. Both of Lauren McCarthy’s works, Later Date (2020) and Social Turkers (2013), are about desire for social interaction, intimacy and agency and the potential role of digital communication technologies as their facilitator.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Social Turkers (2013)</span>
In her performance <span style="font-style:italic">Social Turkers</span>, Lauren live streams a number of dates employing <span style="font-style:italic">Amazon Mechanical Turk</span> - a “crowdsourcing marketplace,“ used to outsource tasks to a distributed workforce who can perform the assignments virtually. The artist lets the <span style="font-style:italic">Mechanical Turks</span> make decisions on her behalf and guide her through the encounters. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Later Date (2020)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic">Later Date</span> is a highly topical work on the desire for - the indefinitely postponed possibility of - physical social interaction in times of the pandemic. <span style="font-style:italic">Later Date</span> is a work in two parts: the router.gallery is showing the first part, a documentation of plans made between the artist and various participants. The second part will take place on an agreed upon later date, when both parties will receive email requests to meet and enact the script. Visitors of the router.gallery will be asked to plan their own future <span style="font-style:italic">Later Date</span>. 
<br>
<br>
While the potential for intimacy and physicality in <span style="font-style:italic">Social Turkers</span> is overtly apparent, it is at the same time meditated, enabled and interrupted by <span style="font-style:italic">MTurk</span>. <span style="font-style:italic">Later Date</span> on the other hand is an emphatic deceleration of the omnipresent demand for communication by type of <span style="font-style:italic">Zoom</span> calls. Conversations in <span style="font-style:italic">Later Date</span> are reduced to a text only chat between two participants pursuing the need for intimacy – a format perfectly fit for the intimate experience enabled by the router.gallery.
<br>
In line with the CTM festival theme <span style="font-style:italic">Transformation</span>, the artist’s works are hybrids of on- and offline performances, as well as their documentation on the internet. As the router.gallery takes the web pages offline, it highlights them not only as documents created by the artist to make the original performance accessible, but as narrative works of art. </p>
